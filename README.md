# 📝 Noted — The Game-Changing Note & Drawing App

**Noted** is a powerful and beautifully designed productivity tool that redefines how you take notes, draw ideas, brainstorm, design UI/UX, and express creativity. Inspired by the best of **Notion** and **Excalidraw**, but built to go beyond.

## 🧠 Philosophy

We didn’t want to make another boring productivity tool with a navbar and footer.  
**Noted** is built for people who think differently — students, designers, educators, developers, and dreamers.

> “The goal isn’t just to take notes. It’s to think visually, freely, and beautifully.”
