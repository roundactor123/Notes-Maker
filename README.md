## 🧠 Philosophy

We didn’t want to make another boring productivity tool with a navbar and footer.  
**Noted** is built for people who think differently — students, designers, educators, developers, and dreamers.

> “The goal isn’t just to take notes. It’s to think visually, freely, and beautifully.”
